# Palmetto Cluster Chatbot

## Introduction

The Palmetto Cluster is a high-performance computing resource provided by the Clemson University Research Computing & Data (RCD) team for student and faculty researchers to use. 

## Project

Given the learning curve for using Palmetto, we saw an opportunity to develop a chatbot that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alongside the cluster's [comprehensive documentation](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/) to answer researcher questions.
